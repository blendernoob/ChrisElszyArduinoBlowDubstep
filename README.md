Just as a note for those who look into this

You must map the midi signals in your DAW of choice. The inclosed video shows off the arduino being used in Abelton Live.

Blow into the Circuit Playground to increase the midi notes and automoate things.

You can also increase a multiplier to add even more energy into your blows by hitting one of the left button.

Enjoy
